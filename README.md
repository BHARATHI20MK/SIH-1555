## Problem Title
SIH 1555: Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
## Problem Description
### Challenge Statement:
Design and develop an engaging, educational, and immersive Virtual Herbal Garden that highlights a wide variety of medicinal plants used across AYUSH systems (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).

### Background:
The AYUSH system heavily relies on medicinal plants for traditional treatments. However, physical herbal gardens are limited in accessibility. A digital alternative—a Virtual Herbal Garden—will help bridge this accessibility gap, allowing users to explore and learn about these plants from anywhere.

### Objective:
Create an intuitive and interactive virtual platform that educates users about medicinal herbs through 3D models, multimedia content, and user-friendly tools.
